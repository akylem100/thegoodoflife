      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Help any reader learn specific life skills to excel in the world. This website will break down how to improve yourself
        as a person through means of finance, mental health, social confidence, and more. Having a dream starts you somewhere, but 
        having a blueprint to success gets you to the finish line. "The Good of Life" will emphasize on common problems we face as people
        and provides a starter solution to bring anyone in the dark towards the right direction. 
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Any audience is welcome to visit and read my website. Primarily, however, young adults are invited to read and think about what will be presented. I believe 
        in sharing perspectives and there's no better way to do that than one adult hearing another, and in return sharing their feedback depending on the choice of topic. It would be
        a bigger site goal to allow a chatbox where users can share their ideas and ways to help me improve as well. Critical thinking about each one of the topics discussed is especially
        welcome!

      <h3>The Good of Life</h3>
      <p>
        (Title) "We're all in this. To be better together." </br>(Content) "The purpose of this website is to collect and combine key information 
        that helps YOU become a better person, as well as those around you. There is a passionate outlook on
        the topics of self-esteem, finance, social confidence, and physical fitness. There are countless other ways to improve, but
        these four areas will be the main focus." </p>
        (page break)

        "'The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change.'
        ― Carl R. Rogers, On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View of Psychotherapy" </br> "Guess what? We're all built imperfect. We need to
        understand who we are NOW, why we ARE here, and ultimately what we WILL be if we change. We cannot expect ourselves to be better if we do not
        take initiative towards progression. Too many times we are embarrassed! Embarrassed by our own mistakes and weaknesses. That is not easy to let go 
        for some; however, we must accept who we are first. Hence, knowing who we are now. What makes you amazing? What have you achieved? What do others
        admire about you? <br> Certainly, YOU bring value to this world and many others you've met see that, but don't always admit it. </p>
      <p>(Title #2) "Discover your purpose. Define why you're here."<br> "Are you striving to live a good life? Maybe a life with more joy, freedom, fun, or simply peace.
        Whatever you're looking for, finding and accomplishing your purpose will help you get there. If you believe in God, it will be easier to see a greater perspective
        of our purpose. If you don't believe in God, that's understandable too. Ultimately, we are here to become better people and do so by following examples of those
        who influence us for good. Speaking on behalf of myself, I am a believer of God and His son Jesus Christ. Jesus is an immense role model for me since
        He teaches and represents valuable principles, such as faith. Faith is a common religious term, but it can relate to all life situations. <br> Faith encompasses
        TRUSTING in yourself and God to accomplish something that you do not feel confident doing. It means exiting your own comfort zone and entering the everlasting zone
        of discovery. When you exercise faith to do anything, you run a life of success being able to do more than you ever could before. GIVE IT A TRY! If you're interested
        in learning more about faith and similar principles of change, you can also visit comeuntochrist.org, which gives a more definite perspective on edifying life principles. "
      <p>(Title #3) "Take what you know and drive it into action."<br>'Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.' — Benjamin Disraeli
        Remember reader(s): It matters less to me what you take away from this site or external sources; however, the 'cherry on top' lesson you NEED to follow is applying what
        you learn. There will be a small sentence or sum of words that will strike home to you; demonstrate your self care and APPLY IT! <br> Regret has no greater meaning
        than wishing you would have not missed out from a life-changing experience. Do not wait. Take what you learn and drive it into action!!

      <h3>Mental Wellness</h3>
      <p>
        (Title) "Mentality influences everything else."<br>Do you recall a time when someone made you laugh or smile? Do you remember how you felt throughout the day because
        of that? Or how about a negative experience; have you gone through a heated argument and felt a weight on your shoulders after, as if the hike just got 2x steeper and 4x heavier?
        No matter how we let experiences affect us, our CHOICE to behave mentally changes everything else. Being prepared mentally means having control over the way you think and react.
        How do we better control our minds?
      </p>
      <p>Here are some quick tips to heal/grow mentally: <br>1. Clear your mind. <br>2. Manage new stress. <br>3. Eat/Drink something healthy and filling. <br>4. Practice discipline. <br> 5. Seek support from peers.</p>
      <p>How you choose to utilize these steps and other techniques is your call. I personally clear my mind through meditation, or moments of mindfulness. When you rediscover who you are that way, your cognitive
        abilities are enlightened. You will feel more confdient. You find peace. I testify of this and also stand by healthy ways of "escapes" from the world. Music, in my case, helps
        immensely. Find what clears your mind! <br>
        Your mind will forgive you by applying discipline. Life is different when you control it more effectively. Complete a task not because you need to, but because you want it. ALWAYS see a positive
        side in what you do. The reward comes after all you are able to do with discipline. This has been my goal for 2023 - becoming more disciplined, and I can say it has helped me be a totally new person.
        Life is much more productive.

      <h3>Financial Stability</h3>
      <p>
        (Title) "Financial literacy fuels freedom."<br>We all secretly want to live life as we please. Healthy financial habits will open the door to abundant
        opportunities of freedom. There is so much information available on the internet that will guide you to be better with money. Why would you need to be good with money? Is life not
        more than just earning income and buying goods? We all love materialistic goods; however, learning to work hard manage money may have a more eternal meaning behind it. We can become
        happier by knowing we're trying our best to do what's right. What is right in the financial world? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some tips to help YOU avoid financial heartaches:<br>1.Build/Fix credit score.<br>2.Work beyond expectations.<br>3. Resist impulse buying. Do you really need that?<br>4. Escape debt traps (pay off all debt asap).
        <br>5. Stop spending, start investing.<br>6. Donate, serve the needy. </p>
      <p>
        "Most people are afraid of not having money... if you focus everyday on your lack of money, then your future will give you what you focus on" - Ryan Serhant
        <br>You will likely experience less stress as you become more financially stable. This kind of education leads to more rewards as it is done. Too many people are distracted by the idea of a prosperous life, but when positive
        goals to manage money are done in a controlled manner, another level of satisfaction is achieved. When you take care of money, you will be able to focus on many other
        life obligations. You can live life differently and gain new experiences when you set yourself up financially. Most importantly, you can support those you love
        and also donate to needy organizations. Life is better lived with more money; just enough to support yourself and your loved ones while minimizing negative stress.
