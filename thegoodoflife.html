        <h2>Discover your purpose. <br> <u>Define why you are here.</u></h2> <br>
        <p>Are you striving to live a good life? Maybe a life with more joy, freedom, fun, or simply peace.
        Whatever you're looking for, finding and accomplishing your purpose will help you get there. According
        to a gospel principle about our purpose on life, we are here to become better and do so by following
        examples of those who influence us for good. Speaking on behalf of myself, I am a believer of God and His
        son Jesus Christ. Jesus is an immense role model for me since He teaches and represents valuable principles,
        such as faith. Faith is a common religious term, but it can relate to all life situations.
        <br> <br> <br>
        Faith encompasses TRUSTING in yourself and God to accomplish something that you do not feel confident doing.
        It means exiting your own comfort zone and entering the everlasting zone of discovery. When you exercise
        faith to do anything, you run a life of success being able to do more than you ever could before. GIVE IT A
        TRY! If you're interested in learning more about faith and similar principles of change, you can also visit 
        comeuntochrist.org, which gives a more definite perspective over edifying life principles.
