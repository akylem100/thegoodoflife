        <p>Do you recall a time when someone made you laugh or smile? Do you remember how you felt throughout
        the day because of that? Or how about a negative experience; have you gone through a heated
        argument and felt a weight on your shoulders after, as if the hike just got 2x steeper and 
        4x heavier? No matter how we let experiences affect us, our CHOICE to react mentally changes
        everything else. Being prepared mentally means having control over the way you think and react.
        <br> How do we better control our minds?

        How you choose to utilize these steps and other techniques is your call. I personally clear my
        mind through meditation, or moments of mindfulness. When you rediscover who you are that way, your
        cognitive abilities are enlightened. You will feel more confident. You find peace. I testify of
        this and also stand by healthy ways of "escapes" from the world. Music, in my own case, helps immensely.
        <br><br>Find what clears your mind!<br><br>
        Your mind will forgive you by applying discipline. Life is different when you control it more effectively.
        Complete a task not because you need to, but because you want it. ALWAYS see a positive side in what you
        do. The reward comes after all that you are able to do within your own control. Having a goal of discipline
        makes all the difference. Controlling myself and my actions has helped me become a new person. Life is
        much more productive as we learn to act.
